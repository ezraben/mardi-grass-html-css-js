              The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
              including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
              for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
              before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
              tradition)<span id="reMoreGeneral" class="Rdmore">Read more...</span>
              <div id="showGeneral" > Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
                most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
                Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
                (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
                organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established
                krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
                krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such
                as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
                celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of
                Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
                as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
                African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws
                into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful
                plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon
                Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same
                parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center
                their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
                along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
                Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras
                day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
                the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

              The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was
              at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower

              Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of
              Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
              festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by
              Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and
              costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man -
              The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls
              was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
              streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited
              by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were
              lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
              Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised
              money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy
              in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces
              describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.

              The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans
              are green, gold, and purple. <span id="rdColors" class="Rdmore">Read more...</span> <div id="showColors"> The colors were first specified in
              proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
              inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
              banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors
              were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
              selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
              symbolism.
            
              Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex
              Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on
              heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
              Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their
              "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white
              was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus
              avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and
              purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which
              states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next
              to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to
              other colors.[28] Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that

                New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi
                Gras celebration as hosts of many of the parades on or around
                Mardi Gras. <span id="rdTreditiions" class="Rdmore">Read more...</span>
              <div id="showTreditions"> The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are
                both social club parades. Zulu is a mostly African-American club
                and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls,
                starting in late January. At these social balls, the queen of
                the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21,
                not married and in high school or college) and the king (an
                older male member of the club) present themselves and their
                court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different
                divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and
                parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball
                at local bar room. In response to their exclusion from Rex, in
                1909 Créole and black New Orleanians, led by a mutual aid group
                known as "The Tramps", adorned William Storey with a tin can
                crown and banana stalk scepter and named him King Zulu.[5][40]
                This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated
                pageantry, but in time, Zulu became a grand parade in its own
                right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige,
                the krewe named New Orleans' native son Louis Armstrong as its
                king

                One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the
                crowds, doubloons are large coins, either wood or metal, made in
                Mardi Gras colors. <span id="rdDoubloons" class="Rdmore">Read more...</span> 
                <div id="showDoubloons"> Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern
                doubloon for The School of Design (the actual name of the Rex
                organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959
                Sharpe arrived at the offices of the captain of the krewe with a
                handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw
                the doubloons into the captain's face to prove that they would
                be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons
                usually portray the Krewe's emblem, name, and founding date on
                one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the
                other side. Royalty and members of the court may throw specialty
                doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons given
                out by men on horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade,
                krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float. Krewes also
                mint special doubloons of cloisonné or pure silver for its
                members. They never throw these from the floats. Original Rex
                doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for
                aficionados to find a certified original doubloon. The School of
                Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years
                after their introduction.

            LaToya Cantrell (Democratic Party) is the Mayor of New Orleans in
            Louisiana. Cantrell assumed office on May 7, 2018. Cantrell's
            current term ends on January 12, 2026. Cantrell (Democratic Party)
            won re-election for Mayor of New Orleans in Louisiana outright in
            the primary on November 13, 2021, after the general election was
            canceled. Cantrell rose to local prominence through her work to
            recover and restore the Broadmoor neighborhood following Hurricane
            Katrina in 2005. In 2012, she won a special election for the New
            Orleans City Council to serve a partial term. Cantrell was elected
            to a full term in 2014, where she sponsored a measure prohibiting
            smoking in city bars and casinos.
