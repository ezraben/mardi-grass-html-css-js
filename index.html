        <h3 class="articleH3">Mardi gras history</h3>
        <article >
          <div class="article">
          <p>
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
            through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
            House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
            Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.
          </p>

          <p>
            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne
            Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly
            south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his
            men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also
            established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in
            1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
            celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile),
            similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted
            until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
            from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's
            head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with
            an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat
            fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
          </p>

          <p>
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s,
            Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the
            parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
            Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
            became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
          </p>

          <p>
            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781
            report to the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the
            Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
            hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers
            with carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras.
            Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the
            krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and
            festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick
            Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their
            organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with
            dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe
            members remained anonymous. In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the
            Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded
            account of Mardi Gras "throws."
          </p>

          <p>
            Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they
            even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of parades' fantastic
            float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
            always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these
            reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
            beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds,"
            these chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color,
            doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta
            Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these
            designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian
            paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was
            responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional
            outfits.
          </p>

          <p>
            1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of
            Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime parade. To honor
            the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen
            introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as
            Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for
            power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that
            Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was
            cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New
            Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The
            Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
            paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock
            both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
            Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act,"
            making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes
            today developed from private social clubs with restrictive
            membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are
            completely funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the
            "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

          <h3 class="articleH3">Mardi gras tradition</h3>
          <div class="article">
          <p>
            Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement.
            It's one big holiday in New Orleans! Revelers know to wear costumes
            or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
            with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll
            see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
            everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade
            goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great
            food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras
            day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because
            of the celebration.
          </p>

          Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can
          haul away all the beads and trinkets they will catch from the parades!
          Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how
          the traditions have changed. Click on the buttons below to find out
          the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.</p>

          <h3 class="articleH3">Mardi Gras Tips</h3>
          <div class="article">
          <p>Most of the Central Business District and French Quarter hotels require a four to five day minimum stay, and they steadily book blocks of rooms beginning in August. Make your reservations now!

Hotels are often solidly booked by December, so reserve ahead of time. Check out recommended hotels close to the action or Mardi Gras packages. If they are sold out, we also recommend the hotels that are listed on BestNewOrleansHotels.com.

Okay, so it's January, and you decide you want to visit New Orleans on Fat Tuesday. Should you even try? Yes! It is worth it, but just be prepared to spend a lot of time on the phone. Keep calling. Hotels have cancellations, and there are waiting lists. If you are persistent, you just may find a place somewhere.

And remember, the parades and festivities start well before Fat Tuesday! Hotels often have rooms available when the parades first begin. This is a great time to visit New Orleans if you want to see some parades and get a great Mardi Gras experience without all the crowds.</p>
<p>Don't Wait Until January To Start Planning Your Trip
Yes, we touched on this in the tip above, but it's so important that it bears repeating. Waiting to make reservations usually isn't a good idea if you have definitely decided to enjoy Mardi Gras in New Orleans. You might get lucky, but there is no guarantee. If you like to gamble and don't want to reserve the minimum night stay required at most hotels, then you can wait and see if those hotels will relax their minimum night stay requirements if they have rooms that need to be filled. But there is no guarantee this will happen. You definitely don't want to come to New Orleans looking for a room.</p>
<p>Know The New Parade Rules
The New Orleans City Council passed new Mardi Gras parade rules in early 2014. Be sure you know them before you head out to the parades to avoid tickets, and to avoid bringing a bunch of stuff that you'll just have to move later. The new rules are as follows:
There can be no ladders or other personal effects, like grills and coolers, closer than 6 feet to the curb.
Parking on Napoleon and St. Charles will be prohibited on BOTH sides of the neutral ground this year, not just the parade side, starting 2 hours before the parade.
There is now a ban on roping off territory via chairs, tarps, or anything else if you are in the public right of way. This includes neutral ground and
There can be no private portable toilets in the neutral ground or other public property.</p>
